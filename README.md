# Huubster
Huubster connects automobile specialists with people looking to buy a used car.

## About the company
Huubster aims to change the way the second-hand car market works. A car purchase is a big step in everyone’s life, whether because of the idea of independence or just because of the costs associated, yet, unless you buy new, there are lots of risks. We intend to decrease those risks by providing an evaluation that will help you make the best buying decision possible, with all the information in your possession

## Development
Huubster is currently being developed by Gonçalo Novo. It's made using Ruby on Rails.
